### To Enhance This README:
1. Replace the placeholder image URLs with actual screenshots or GIFs.
2. Use GIF-making tools (e.g., [EZGIF](https://ezgif.com/)) to create animations for:
   - Live demos of ESP8266 Smart Garden or QuadCopter.
   - Circuit setups and hardware in action.
3. Place media files in an `assets/` folder in the repository and reference them directly.

Would you like me to assist further in organizing this README for a specific repository?
